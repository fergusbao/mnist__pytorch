# mnist_pytorch

Most of project is from the following project.  
https://github.com/moemen95/Pytorch-Project-Template  

I will add more features to this template.  
10/5 -- The train/test loss and the model graph are logged to Tensorboard  
10/5 -- Add early stopping  
10/5 -- save the best checkpoint and load the checkpoint(save and load only the model parameters)  
10/5 -- save train/test loss and model every log interval (10) epochs to increase the efficiency  
10/5 -- To do (log hparams for different hparams settings) currently, only one set of hparams will be read/used from json file.
